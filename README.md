1.	How do I approach designing software?

o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  The ability to work with 3d objects in a code base environment was new to me and helped me learn a lot about OpenGL.
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
  My design process was to really understand the 3D scene I was trying to create, so I took a few different pictures at different angles to help with that. After that I began to work on the basic shapes of the objects in the scene, then tweaked them to my liking. Then it was   just a process of adding textures and colors to the scene to make it look more realistic.
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I believe this approach will help me take a deeper look into projects into the future to have as a complete understanding of them as I can before beginning. Starting with small building blocks and adding to it to create a complete project.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  I’m not sure if anything was particularly new, but I believe I am better at designing and creating the overall structure for a project.
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
  When working on this project, going through and trying and testing, then going back and trying and testing again.
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
  At first starting with the basic layout them moving to textures and materials is what helped me go through the project in steps that seemed easy to understand, and easy to somewhat replicate for future projects.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
	
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  This class helped me understand the basics of computer visualization and OpenGL which could be applied to many projects both in school and in my future workplace.
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  This class also helped me to write in a more organized manner as well as improved my commenting and documentation abilities, which are valuable skills in software engineering.
